Files
-------------------------------- --------------------------------

The main files are the following: 

	modifyme.m     
		- is the only file that should need modifying once the experiment is run

	runexp.m       
		- is the master file. All other scripts are called by this file.  This is the
		  file that should be run in the matlab window to start the experiment. 

The files that do the main work are: 

	preps.m        
		- is the file that sets up the stimulus presentation sequences, ensuring that
		  all stimuli, actions and presentations are counterbalanced etc. 

	setup.m        
		- sets up the display variables, starts psychtoolbox and its sound
		  subcomponent, and loads all the images that'll be needed. 

	pittraining.m  
		- is the instrumental training 

	pit.m          
		- is the PIT 

	pavlov.m       
		- is the pavlovian training

	compare.m      
		- are the test trials interleaved with the Pavlovian training


Any file with 'instr' in it is some sort of instruction.  In addition, there are
two .mat files with random numbers which I use to counterbalance
approach/withdrawal presentation order across subjects. Finally, there are a
couple of 'helper' files for stuff I use a lot again and again: 

	centermouseclick.m 
		- displays the organge square to re-centre the mouse after each trial

	checkabort.m   
		- To abort, hold down the escape key and click with the mouse a couple of
		  times. This file aborts the experiment if you do that. 

	displaytext.m and displaycentraltext.m 
		- are files that display text, either just a single line or a series of
		  lines, nicely centred

	givebreak.m    
		- inserts a 2 minute break after the first block

	mygetclicks.m  
		- waits for a mouse click

Variables
-------------------------------- --------------------------------

I guess it might be helpful to just mention a few of the variable names and
their meaning. The ones that need altering are in the 'modifyme' script, and are
commented there. 

approach is 1 if the current block is an approach block, 0 otherwise

nt   - instrumental trial number 
np   - pavlovian trial number 
npit - PIT trial number 

ch, cht, chq
	- variables indicating the subjects' choice in the PIT, instrumental and
	  Pavlovian 'compare' trials respectively. These are 0,1,2,3 or NaN. They are
	  0 if the subject made an invalid trial, 1 2 3 for the box in which the
	  subject clicked, and NaN if the click was outside a box. 

cr, crt, crm 
	- whether correct action in PIT or instrumental block was chosen, or whether
	  correct Pavlovian stimulus was chosen in the Pavlovian comparison trials

pavreact, pitreact and treact 
	- reaction times in Pavlovian 'compare' trials, PIT trials and instrumental
	  trials respectively

Instrumental block

	ainst    correct response (go or nogo) for each trial
	mprest	which mushroom to present in each trial
	lrt		whether to present mushroon on right or left of centre
	crtfb		whether to give accurate or erroneous feedback 
	crt		whether correct action chosen 
	r			whether a reward or punishment was given 

PIT block	
	
	ains    	correct response (go or nogo) for each trial
	mpres		which mushroom to present in each trial
	mpresp	which Pavlovian stimulus to tile the background with
	lr			whether to present mushroon on right or left of centre
	cr			whether correct action made 

Pavlovian block 
	
	pavpres	which Pavlovian stimulus to present
	posp		whether to present the Pavlovian stimulus on left or right
	cppres	which two Pavlovian stimuli to present on comparison trials 
	crm		whether the correct (better) Pavlovian stimulus was chosen on comparison trials
